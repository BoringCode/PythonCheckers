#Python Checkers Game
This respository will store the big project for this semester. 

I can handle a simple game between two manual players. 

Support for jumps, multiple jumps, and validation of moves is available.

Simple notation for defining moves is: A2:B3. Or multiple jumps: A2:C4:E2

##More to come...

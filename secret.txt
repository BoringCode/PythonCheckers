The secret!

Make a new list of ideal moves. 

Check if a jump or a move is in the crowning list. If so, add to ideal moves. 
Check if a jump or a move is in the block list. If so, add to ideal moves.

Go through each move.
Check to see if making this move could open me up to being jumped (either by moving or removing a block)
	If so, remove the move.
---------------
Check to see if moving could prevent crowning by my opponent.
Now, go through all my moves. Remove moves that move away from my opponent, unless this would result in a jump or otherwise.
Check to see if moving could result in blocking my opponent from moving, but could allow me to jump.

Check to see how much my opponent could gain from my move versus how much I could gain.

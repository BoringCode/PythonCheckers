#Python Checkers

I created this as a project for COS 120 in Fall 2012 at Taylor University.

The basic requirements were to create an automated player with limited AI who could only look 2.5 moves into the future. Sounds like fun right?

I heavily commented mainPlayer.py to give some insight into the thought process behind the player.

**Everything but referee.py was created by me, feel free to take a look around the code**
